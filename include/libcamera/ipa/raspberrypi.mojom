	 *
	 * IPAs shall map the dmabuf file handles to their address space and keep a

	 * in all other IPA interface methods to refer to buffers, including the
	 * unmapBuffers() method.

	 * mapped with this method. Buffers may be mapped all at once with a single
	 * call, or mapped and unmapped dynamically at runtime, depending on the IPA
	 * protocol. Regardless of the protocol, all buffers mapped at a given time
	 * shall have unique numerical IDs.
	 *
	 * The numerical IDs have no meaning defined by the IPA interface, and 
	 * should be treated as opaque handles by IPAs, with the only exception
	 * that ID zero is invalid.
